#break breaks out of enclosing loop 

#continue asks to break out of this iteration and start the next one 

#pass - note that pass doesnt really have a functionality except that it is a placeholder for empty space> Eg: 

for i in [1,2,3]: 
  pass

#say we are not sure what to write in for loop above yet. So we cant leave the inside empty because it gives error. So to fill this empty space we do pass 

#not common in production but pass can be seen in development code
