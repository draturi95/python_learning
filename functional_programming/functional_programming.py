# in functional programming we seperate data and functions unlike oop where methods and attributes are in same place

#note that in functional programming, we use pure functions. Pure functions are functions that : 1. Always return same output for the same input
#2. Doesnt have any side effects i.e. the function doesnt interact with the outside world ( print anything or append to a list or uses a variable
# that when changed from outside world, changes the output of the function
